Encryption
==========

A fun encryption app I use to communicate with my friends

This application is intended to be used by just a few people. Because it uses the same encryption algorithem between all users, 
it is possible to decrypt any message encoded with this app as long as it is installed on your device.

I have plans to develop a more complex application including social capabilities and different encryption keys based on the user you are sending the message to.

For the time being, have fun with this application, and I hope that you like it.




Special thanks to Ali Karagoz for providing me with the fabulous MCSwipeTableViewCell, similar to the ones used in the Mailbox app.
